# Blade-fc
Blade is a chess engine written purely in c and run on the CPU, though there will evetually be versions with cuda that support GPU computing. It is an attempt to see the effects of different training methods on the strength of the engine.
For now the used neural network used is not convolutional, since I haven't had the time to implement those yet.
# Moving forward
Since the chess implementation is now finished I will now work on the implementation of convolutional neural networks.
After the convolutional neural networks are implemented I will work on the implementation of self play learning and then start testing various training methods that should hopefully result in a relatively strong chess engine.
For now the chess implementation is not really optimised very well and it will only become the focus when the most promising training implementations are up and running.
